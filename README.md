# Cobblemon Megamons: Mega Pokémon for Cobblemon

Welcome to Cobblemon Megamons! This Cobblemon side mod brings Mega Evolutions to your Cobblemon experience, 
allowing players to obtain Mega Stones and Mega Evolve their Pokémon.

Below is a brief overview of the mod's features, configuration options, support channels, 
credits to the development team, license information, and future development plans.


## Features

- **Mega Stones**: Mega Stones for Generation 1 Pokémon are now obtainable in survival mode.(Mewtwo X and Y are available in Creative mode)
- **Mega Bracelet**: Equip the Mega Bracelet to initiate Mega Evolution. The bracelet will appear on the player model's wrist.
- **Geode Generation**: Discover geodes in the world, featuring new building blocks, abundant evolutionary stones, and Mega Stone ore!
- **Lore Accurate**: Our team has meticulously crafted the mod to align with the lore of Pokémon, ensuring an immersive and faithful experience within the Minecraft universe.

## Mega Evolution guide
Mega stone ore can be found within newly spawned geodes, and these new ores drop Raw Mega Stones, which can be cut into 
Cut Mega Stones in the stonecutter. Once the player obtains an Anistarite Crystal Block, which make up the crystal structure of the 
new geodes, they can craft a Key Stone. The Key Stone is required to craft the Mega Cuff.

The Mega Cuff can be used on a Pokémon holding its correct Cut Mega Stone (e.g. Blastoise holding Blastoisinite)
to Mega Evolve them.

The Mega Pokémon must be holding its Cut Mega Stone to remain in its Mega Form.

## Configuration

- **Mega Pokémon Limit**: The number of Mega Pokémon a player is allowed to have can be configured to suit server or player preferences.
Adjust this setting to balance gameplay according to your needs.
